## Introducing Netrunner for Next.js and AWS S3

Netrunner streamlines the process of integrating AWS S3 storage into your Next.js application. It is a storage development tool that creates and configures AWS S3 buckets for you, and provides you with instant APIs and code snippets for file uploads.

And it doesn't stop at just configuration - Netrunner also supplies you with file previews for any media and easy-to-use security policy configurations, so that you don't have to reinvent the wheel.
